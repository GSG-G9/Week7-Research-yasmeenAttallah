#  HTTP vs HTTPS



## -   How does HTTPS work? What are TLS/SSL certificates?

HTTP :

-   is the abbreviation for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    
-   Web page consist of object .
    
-   Object can be html file , text, grapgic image , sound ,vedio and other multimedia
    
-   each object is addressed by URL
    
-   client/server model .
    
-   It is available at port 80.
- 
HTTPS:

-   is the abbreviation for hypertext transfer protocol secure
    
-   is a combination of HTTP with using certificate knows as secure socket layer (SSL)/ or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol provides encrypted connection .
    
-   it is available at a new port (443) .

Who does https work ?

-   creates a secure, encrypted connection between a browser and a server.
    
-   SSL certificate encrypts a connection with a level of protection that is designated at your time of the purchase of an SSL certificate.
    
-   ssl certificate provides an extra layer of security for sensitive data that you do not want third-party attackers to access.
    
-   TLS it helps encrypt HTTPS and can be used to secure email and other protocols.
**What are TLS/SSL certificates?**

**SSL :**

-   secure socket layer .
    
-   keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems
    
-   consists of two subprotocols, one for establishing a secure connection  and one for using it
    

**TLS :**

-   Transport Layer Security
    
-   evolved from Secure Socket Layers (SSL).
    
-   ensures the secure delivery of data over the Internet.
## Why is this important to implement in your projects?

-   Web site using HTTPs are more trust for users .
- HTTPS authenticates websites.
 -   HTTPS encrypts all user data.
-  Chrome and other browsers mark all HTTP websites as "not secure."
